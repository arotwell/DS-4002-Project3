ASL Image Dataset

(Metadata for /DATA folder — MI3 Requirement)

Data Summary

This dataset was retrieved from Mendeley Data and contains 5,200 labeled PNG images representing hand-shaped signs of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. The dataset includes all static letters except ‘J’ and ‘Z’, as these require motion and cannot be captured as still images. It also includes the additional signs “SP” (Space) and “FN” (Finish).

All images are clearly labeled with their corresponding letter or symbol.

The dataset used in this project is stored in our GitHub repository:
