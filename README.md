# ASL Alphabet Interpretation with a Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains all files and documentation for our **DS 4002 Project 3**, which explores the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs from static images.  
Our goal is to evaluate whether a CNN can accurately identify ASL alphabet letters based on image input.
